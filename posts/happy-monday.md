# Hello Everyone, Happy Monday! 
We have some exciting news and updates to share with you.

## ARC ‚ö°
We‚Äôre thrilled to express our full support for the *Armada Ruleset Collective (ARC)*, a project dedicated to refining and enhancing *Star Wars: Armada*. We hope to work in away that bolsters the community alongside ARC. We will never work against them and our greatest hope is that each of our projects can help keep the community united. There are many talented and passionate people on the ARC team, and we believe they‚Äôre doing amazing work for the long-term health of *Star Wars: Armada*. **Armada Legacy** and ARC have no partnership currently but we at Legacy hope the door to collaboration could be opened in the future.
