# September Community Update
### Hello Everyone!

We have some thrilling news to share with you today as we hit **2,000 members** in our Discord community! Thank you for your continued support and engagement!
## üåê LEGACY RESOURCE WEBSITE
Our new Resource Directory is officially live at https://www.armadalegacy.com/ ! This site is designed to be your one-stop shop for everything you need to play Star Wars: Armada, even as the game has been discontinued. We‚Äôre continually adding new links to resources, so be sure to check back often! 
*If you are a vendor and don't have access to our vendor channel please DM me so we can get connected!*
## üìä COMMUNITY POLL
We're also hosting a **poll for the best Star Wars video game**! We want to hear your thoughts and favorite games, so be sure to check out the poll #polls!
## üåä WAVE 0: OPENING SALVO
Finally, we are **very** excited to announce that our first wave in the new development process will be called **Wave 0: Opening Salvo**. This wave will be smaller than the waves of the previous dev team, allowing us to test our refined development process with a more focused sample size. We‚Äôre aiming for a tentative launch towards the end of **October**. We are very excited for you all to try what we've made!

Thank you all for being a part of this incredible journey! Let‚Äôs continue to build something amazing together!

May the Force be with you!
**The Armada Legacy Team**
